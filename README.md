Question 1

Pastoral College is a small college in the Midwest. Design the pseudo-code

for a program that accepts a student name, major field of study, and grade

point average. Display a student’s data with the message “Dean’s list” if the

student’s grade point average is above 3.5, “Academic probation” if the grade

point average is below 2.0, and no message if the grade point average is

between 2.0 and 3.5 inclusive.

Question 2

The Summerville Telephone Company charges 20 cents per minute for all calls

outside the customer’s area code. All other calls are 15 cents per minute.

Design the pseudo-code for a program that accepts data about a phone call:

customer area code (three digits), customer phone number (seven digits),

called area code (three digits), called number (seven digits), and call time

in minutes (four digits). Display the calling number, called number, and

price for the call.

Design an application that will convert either Fahrenheit to Celsius or

Celsius to Fahrenheit. Have the user enter a 1 to convert Fahrenheit to

Celsius and a 2 for Celsius to Fahrenheit. If the user enters any other

number, output an error message. Once the user enters a 1, do the input,

calculation and output for a Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion. If the user

enters a 2, do the input, calculation and output for a Celsius to Fahrenheit

conversion. Also, write the pseudo-code.

Question 4

Design an application that will Calculate the area of a Shape. Have the user

enter a “C” to use a Circle, an “S” to use a Square and an “R” to use a

Rectangle. If the user enters any other letter or number, output an error

message. Once the user enters a “C”, do the input, calculation and output to

Calculate the area of a Circle. If the user enters an “S”, do the input,

calculation and output to Calculate the area of a Square. If the user enters

an “R”, do the input, calculation and output to Calculate the area of a

Rectangle. Also write the pseudo-code.
